## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Page not found" on refresh

**Fix:** Already configured in `vercel.json` with rewrites. Should work automatically.

### Issue: Environment variables not working

**Fix:** 
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Project Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
4. Redeploy the project

### Issue: "Auth error" or "Can't login"

**Fix:** Check that Supabase environment variables are correct and match your Supabase project.

### Issue: Stuck at "Pending" after login

**Fix:** This was fixed by:
1. Running `EMERGENCY-FIX-PROFILE-ACCESS.sql` in Supabase
2. Changing `<a href>` to React Router navigation in HeroSection
3. Should not occur in production

SET role = 'superadmin', is_verified = true
WHERE email = 'their-email@example.com';
```

3. They must log out and log back in to see changes
