## 🐛 **Quick Troubleshooting**

### **Email not sending?**
```bash
# Check function logs
supabase functions logs send-exhumation-notification

# Test function directly
supabase functions invoke send-exhumation-notification --data '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "plotId": "TEST-001",
  "status": "approved",
  "requestType": "OUT",
  "requestId": "test-123",
  "deceasedName": "Test Person",
  "requestorName": "Test User"
}'
```

### **Documents not uploading?**
```sql
-- Check bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'exhumation-documents';

-- Check policies
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'exhumation-documents';
```

### **Request not appearing in dashboard?**
```sql
-- Check if request was saved
SELECT * FROM exhumation_requests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check admin can see it (RLS)
SELECT * FROM exhumation_requests WHERE status = 'pending';
```
