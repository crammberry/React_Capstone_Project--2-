-- =================================================================
-- FIX ALL ADMIN RLS POLICIES FOR EXHUMATION AND RESERVATION SYSTEMS
-- =================================================================
-- Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix all bugs
-- This script will allow admins to access exhumation_requests and plot_reservations tables
--
-- IMPORTANT: Run this ENTIRE script in one go!
-- =================================================================

-- 1. Enable RLS on both tables (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE exhumation_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE plot_reservations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop ALL existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to insert their own exhumation requests" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to view their own exhumation requests" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to update their own exhumation requests" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to view all exhumation requests" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to update all exhumation requests" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to delete exhumation requests" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for admins" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read for all authenticated users" ON exhumation_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON exhumation_requests;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to insert their own plot reservations" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to view their own plot reservations" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to update their own plot reservations" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to view all plot reservations" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to update all plot reservations" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to delete plot reservations" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for admins" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read for all authenticated users" ON plot_reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON plot_reservations;

-- =================================================================
-- 3. CREATE EXHUMATION_REQUESTS RLS POLICIES
-- =================================================================

-- Drop additional policies that might exist
