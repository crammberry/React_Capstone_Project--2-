# Project Changes Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ All tasks completed successfully

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Build Error Fixed
**Problem:** `npm run build` was failing with a syntax error in HierarchicalCemeteryMap.jsx
- **Error:** "Unexpected export" at line 1956
- **Root Cause:** Missing closing brace `}` for the `renderLevelSelector` function
- **Solution:** Added the missing closing brace before `renderTombDetailsModal` function
- **Result:** Build now completes successfully

### 2. ✅ Mobile Responsive Design Implemented
**Problem:** The cemetery map was not responsive for mobile devices
**Solutions Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive mobile CSS in `index.css` with media queries for:
  - Mobile devices (max-width: 768px)
  - Small mobile devices (max-width: 480px)
  - Tablet landscape (769px - 1024px)
  - Mobile landscape orientation
  - Touch device optimizations
  
**Key Mobile Features:**
- Scrollable map with smooth touch scrolling (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`)
- Increased touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px for buttons)
- Larger stroke width for easier tap targets on plot elements
- Stack layouts vertically on mobile (status legend, forms, buttons)
- Responsive typography (scaled down font sizes)
- Optimized modal sizes for mobile screens
- Removed hover effects on touch devices
- Proper viewport meta tags in `index.html`

### 3. ✅ File Structure Cleanup
**Problem:** Messy file structure with duplicate files and poor organization
**Actions Taken:**
- Created organized folder structure:
  - `backups/` - Old scripts and backup SVG files
  - `database/` - All SQL schema and migration files
  - `docs/` - Documentation and setup guides
- Moved files:
  - 10 SQL files → `database/`
  - 3 documentation files → `docs/`
  - 5 backup files → `backups/`
- Removed duplicate files:
  - Old timestamped SVG files from `public/` and `dist/`
- Updated `README.md` with current project structure
